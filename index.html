                <h1 class="title">Reasons Why I Think Astolfo is Best Girl</h1>
            </header>
            <section>The debate for who is the “best girl” has been a heated discussion, and fans are eager to claim their favorite female characters as the ultimate “waifu.” Opinions are subject to change since new characters are being introduced everytime a new season or series is released. So, I have decided to end this debate once and for all by declaring Astolfo, Rider of Black as the “best girl,” and I will leave my reasons for why I believe this.

                <h1 class="title">Reason One: Good Looks</h1>
            </header>
            <section>Astolfo is  beautiful beyond all comparison. He states that his hair ornaments, which seem like something a princess would wear, are an "irresistible proof of friendship" that he uses to restore peace to his depressively mad boon ally, Roland. His appearance is contrary to the legend of being said to be the most handsome among the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne, and though extremely unexpected, it is natural for legends to become distorted. He purposefully dresses "as a girl" because he likes cute things.</section>

                <h1 class="title">Reason Two: Optimism and Personality</h1>
            </header>
            <section>Astolfo is known for being eternally optimistic and completely lacking in sense, and he can be called "curiosity in human form." He is a blabbermouth, prone to speaking on and on until those involved lose all rationality. His conversations, through no ill intent on his part, have a way of meandering toward maximum social awkwardness. However, he is loyal and protective of his friends.

                <h1 class="title">Reason Three: Deep Understanding</h1>
            </header>
            <section>Since Astolfo is a guy, he knows how men can truly feel. He can understand and lifts your spirits with his optimism. This also makes conversations easier. If you asked any girl what she wants to eat, you will NEVER get a direct response. She may say “I don’t know, you pick.” You may recommend something and she will reject that idea. Or she may say, “I’m not hungry,” then immediately grab some of your food and eat it. With Astolfo, you don’t have to worry about any of that since he understands you.

                <h1 class="title">Reason Four: Protection</h1>
            </header>
            <section id="protectionSection">Even though Astolfo wasn’t the strongest of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne, he isn't a pushover. He is equipped with a lance called The Trap of Argalia. This lance was intended for jousting and touched by it, it turns the person it touches into their spiritual form below the knee. In other words, remove their calf. This is because the magic imbued in the lance was meant to make whoever it touches fall. The next noble phantasm is La Black Luna, a horn that can destroy an army. It makes a loud and explosive sound that hits hard. The third noble phantasm is Casseur de Logistille (Destruction Declaration) and it contains the power to destroy all magic, making Astolfo immune to all magic attacks. Sadly, Astolfo forgot the name of the book and can only remember on a New Moon.

            Bonus: He has a cool Hippogriff, the upper body of an eagle and the lower half of a horse. He can take you anywhere you want.
